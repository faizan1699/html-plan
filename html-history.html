        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>
          HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It is the
          standard language used to create pages on the World Wide Web.
        </p>

        <h2>Early days (1990s)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Around 1990, Tim Berners‑Lee created the first version of HTML while
            working at CERN.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the early 1990s, HTML was very small and simple: basic text,
            links, lists, and images.
          </li>
          <li>
            There was no CSS or JavaScript yet — pages were plain and mostly
            text.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>HTML 2.0, 3.2, 4.01</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML 2.0</strong> (mid‑1990s) collected and standardized the
            early features of HTML.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML 3.2</strong> and <strong>4.01</strong> added more tags,
            tables, forms, and better structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            During this time, many presentation features (like font size and
            color) were done directly in HTML.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>XHTML and strict structure</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the late 1990s and early 2000s, <strong>XHTML</strong> was
            created as a stricter version of HTML based on XML.
          </li>
          <li>
            It required very clean code (proper closing tags, lowercase tags,
            and so on).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>HTML5 and modern web</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML5</strong> started to become popular around 2010 and is
            the main version used today.
          </li>
          <li>
            It added new semantic tags (<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>) and new
            features for audio, video, graphics, and forms.
          </li>
          <li>
            HTML5 works together with <strong>CSS</strong> for styling and
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> for interactivity.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why this matters for you</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Modern HTML is more powerful and easier to read.</li>
          <li>
            Semantic tags help browsers, search engines, and screen readers
            understand your pages better.
          </li>
          <li>
            Learning HTML is still the first step to building modern websites
            and web apps.
          </li>
        </ul>
